# Specification Quality Checklist: Cloudflare Stream Webhook Endpoint

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-03-23
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items passed validation on first review.
- The spec uses protocol-level terminology (HTTP, POST, JSON, webhook signature) which is inherent to the feature domain rather than implementation detail.
- "Azure Functions app" appears in Assumptions only to establish deployment context — this is acceptable domain context.
- Scope is tightly bounded: receive, validate, log. Persistence and downstream processing are explicitly deferred.
